Heroku 
##1-install Heroku https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-java#set-up

##2-Once installed, you can use the heroku command from your command shell.
Log in using the email address and password you used when creating your Heroku account

```sh
$heroku login

```


Authenticating is required to allow both the heroku and git commands to operate.

##3-Prepar the App to Deploy

```sh
$cd My-App

```
First, create an app on Heroku, which prepares Heroku to receive your source code:
```sh
$heroku create

```

When you create an app, a Git remote (named heroku) is also created and associated with your local Git repository.

By default, Heroku generates a random name (in this case warm-eyrie-9006) for your app. You can pass a parameter to specify your own app name.

Now deploy your code:
```sh
$git push heroku master

```

The application is now deployed. Ensure that at least one instance of the app is running:

```sh
$heroku ps:scale web=1

```

Now visit the app at the URL generated by its app name. As a handy shortcut, you can open the website like so:
```sh
$heroku open

```
